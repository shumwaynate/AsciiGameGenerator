# AsciiGameGenerator
I am planning to make here a website that will allow a user to create a game or usable widget. This project will allow the user to, after editing, download or copy the .html, .css, and a single script.js file to add the widget to any website .html. I am starting this as a project for one of my college classes.

# Working Plan Stretches

### Week 1-2: Core Editor for ASCII Art
Goal: Create a basic editor interface to design ASCII characters and objects.
Features: Allow users to position and modify ASCII characters in a grid, and save designs for later use.
### Week 3-4: Game Logic and Movement
Goal: Add the ability to define game rules and character movements.
Features: Implement a system for input-based movement (like W, A, S, D keys), basic interactions, and simple animations.
Export Feature: Generate a script.js file that includes the movement and logic scripts based on user inputs.
### Week 5: Environment Setup and Styling
Goal: Create customizable environments with play areas and style options.
Features: Allow users to set dimensions and styles for the play area and export the settings into an index.html and style.css file.
Styling Options: Provide basic settings like border styles, background color, and ASCII character positioning.
### Week 6: Preview and Testing
Goal: Implement a preview function and debugging tools.
Features: Allow users to test their game in the editor, making adjustments before exporting.
Testing Tools: Add basic tools to check if interactions and movement respond as expected.
### Week 7: Final Export and Documentation
Goal: Build a final export function and create documentation.
Features: Automatically generate index.html, style.css, and script.js files based on user-defined settings and provide easy instructions for integration into any website.
